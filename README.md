This is `React-Spotify`, a React front end client that communicates with the Spotify API.

If you wish to run the code locally run the following.

```
dotnet tool restore
dotnet perla serve
```

Please note that the Spotify API only provides 30 second audio snippets. It may be possible to get the full track by using the [Web Playback SDK](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/).
